# React-Redux based Notification Frontend

This project uses Redux to implement a CRUD Frontend. It can Create and Delete records, the Edit feature is under progress. It uses Ant-Design as the React component library.
I have used Function-based components as that is a recommended practice for using React-Hooks.
